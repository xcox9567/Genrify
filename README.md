In this paper we will take a look at two different architectures of convolutional neural networks, namely ZFNet and GTZANet, and their effectiveness at classifying music by genre.  We implement these models in tensorflow and examine their performance on the GTZAN dataset, in order to gain insight into the strengths of each one.  We conclude from these experiments that while GTZANet was able to marginally outperform ZFNet, though both models display large amounts of room for future improvement.
